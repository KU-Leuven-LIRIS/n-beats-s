# n-beats-s
This repo contains a notebook with a PyTorch implementation of N-BEATS-S from the paper: Van Belle, J., Crevits, R., Verbeke, W., 2022. Improving forecast stability using deep learning.

The code has been developed by Jente Van Belle, Ph.D.
The PyTorch implementation of N-BEATS (N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting) developed by Philippe Remy (https://github.com/philipperemy/n-beats) was used as a starting point.

If you experience any problems, you can contact Jente Van Belle via jente.vanbelle@kuleuven.be.
